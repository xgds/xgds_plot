# Add your modifications below this point

# Uncomment the section below for a production setup. It will turn on
# password authentication, and tweak things to support proxied
# connections coming in through Apache.

# c = get_config()

# One password for all users. To generate a password hash to use here,
# run the following:
#   from IPython.lib import passwd
#   passwd('your_password')
#   [copy and paste output into the line below]

# c.NotebookApp.password = u'... fill in output of passwd() method ...'

# The Tornado server rejects "cross-origin" requests by default, for
# security reasons. In our standard setup, the 'Origin' header in the
# request from Apache to Tornado is 'https://yoursite.xgds.org', but
# the request goes to Tornado over HTTP (HTTP != HTTPS), so we use the
# 'allow_origin_pat' workaround (implemented in the iPython Notebook
# code) to tell Tornado either protocol is ok.  See discussion at
# https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/5525 .

# c.NotebookApp.allow_origin_pat = 'https?://yoursite.xgds.org'

# *Or* you can use this line to totally turn off Tornado's cross-origin
# check.

# c.NotebookApp.allow_origin = '*'  # ... at own risk
